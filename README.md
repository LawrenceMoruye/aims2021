# 3D Computer Vision

This series of lectures will focus on 3D computer vision. We will start with an introduction on 3D representations and explore state-of-the-art models for 3D deep learning.

Each lecture will consist of 

* _a video lecture_: Links to online video lectures along with reading material covering the topics for each lecture. 

* _a Q&A session_: A live Q&A session. 

* _a lab_: A practical lab session followed by a short 1-page report.

After the end of the week,

* _a quiz_: A set of multiple-choice questions covering the material taught throughout the week.

## Lecture 1: 3D representations, 3D object shape from images
_Lecturer: Georgia Gkioxari_

In the first lecture, we will introduce some of the most common 3D representations and dive into state-of-the-art models for 3D shape inference from a single image

* [LECTURE1.md](LECTURE1.md): Reading material and video lectures
* [LAB1.md](LAB1.md): Lab session and short report assignment __(deadline: Sunday, April 18)__


## Lecture 2: Differentiable rendering
_Lecturer: Nikhila Ravi_

In the second lecture, we will dive into an in-depth analysis of differentiable rendering.

* [LECTURE2.md](LECTURE2.md): Reading material and video lectures
* [LAB2.md](LAB2.md): Lab session and short report assignment __(deadline: Sunday, April 18)__

## Lecture 3: 3D Deep Learning
_Lecturer: Georgia Gkioxari_

In the third lecture, we will cover more topics and applications on 3D deep learning.

* [LECTURE3.md](LECTURE3.md): Reading material and video lectures

## Quiz
